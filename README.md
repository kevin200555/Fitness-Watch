# Fitness-Watch
My team and I were tasked with designing, building, and programming a fitness watch.
We were building a fitness tracker, so we decided to name ourselves The Fitness Trackers.
I was in charge of programming and this was my final code for the watch.  I helped my other teammates CAD, build, and soder when needed.  
The fitness watch can count steps, set step goals, count flights of stairs, and display this information on an app.
Our electrical components in our watch were a buzzer, acceleromter, and barometer.  I programmed the functions of these components in the code as well as the app.  
There are also functions in the app that allow the user reset data, set a step goal, and turn off or on the watch.
